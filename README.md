The plugin needs an userscript manager to be launched. Following are the two, that have been tested and working correctly with the script:

1. Tampermonkey for Chrome
2. Greasemonkey for Firefox

The script needs to be adaptated to meet project-specific Jira's requirements (website address, tasks, field ids and request parameters).
